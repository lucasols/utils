description: writing tests
globs:

- Tests should be in `src/` with the same name of the file and the .test.ts extension
- Use vitest `test` instead of `it`
- If i ask you to adjust the code implementation and not only the tests:
  - Run the written tests with `pnpm test ...` to check if the tests pass
  - Always run the tests without asking
